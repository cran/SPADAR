Description: Provides easy to use functions to create all-sky grid plots of widely used astronomical coordinate systems (equatorial, ecliptic, galactic) and scatter plots of data on any of these systems including on-the-fly system conversion. It supports any type of spherical projection to the plane defined by the 'mapproj' package.
